        I know I've told you this before but prom was genuinly one of the best days of my life. Literally
        nothing went as planned and non of that mattered because we made something out of nothing and it was
        completely fine.
        <br>
        <br>
        With that in mind, I love how we're able to do anything together and still have a good time. I could be
        teaching you the difference between Sunday Night and Thursday Night Football and why there isn't a Friday
        Night Football or we could be getting Wendy's at 2 am or just knocking out on in my dorm and it wouldn't
        matter to me because I get to be with you
        <br>

        I don't think you know how much I miss you whenver we go back home for breaks either. Not being able to walk 
        to class or get choolah together or even sleep in bed sucks. I miss your face and talking to you all day and
        I get that everyone needs their space but deep down I want to explode when you're not around. I'd even hope that
        every light turns red when we're in the car together on the way home. So yea what I'm getting at is that
        I miss you more (oops)
