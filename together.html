        To wrap things up, I also made a playlist with songs that you and I like. I know we never really had
        a playlist so hopefully we can listen to this whenever we're studying, driving or anything else. If you
        want to check it out and hopefully add songs just click on the vinyl  
    </p>

            I wrote a bunch of little messaages making this and honestly there's a lot more I could say. What I do know is that
            these are all reasons to why I know that I made the right choice in choosing you. Not only to be my girlfriend, but 
            my wife, and the mother of my kids in the future. I can't wait to hopefully move into our apartment jr year. I also
            can't wait to get our degrees and travel and grow old together.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whatever it is, as long as you're by my side, I'll be okay. I hope you always remember how important you are to me and 
            how thankful I am to have someone special like you in my life. I love you so much <br>- tyler :)
