        I'm so glad that I have you by my side. I say this for many reasons, one being that I can talk to you
        about literally anything. Trust is something that's very important to me and I know that I can trust what
        you say, I can trust your advice, and overall I love that we have an open and trasparent relationship. 
        I don't usually like talking about my dad and stuff like that, especially when we started dating, but 
        I'm glad that you're there for me when I do want to talk about things like that.

        Aside from my mom, you're my #1 supporter. You don't know how appreciative I am that you helped me with 
        my RA application. I remember you had an 8am that day and we weren't even half way done with my essays
        yet you were there with me all night. I'm not sure what to call it but it's acts like this that I cherish
        more than anything really.

        It even got to the point where I knocked out and you clipped me like crazy so watch out. It might not be a 
        big deal to you but knowing that I can count on you for stuff like this moving forward is special to me.
