    <p class="family_message"> I don't think I've touched on this that much but I really like your family and
        I'm glad that I've gotten a lot closer with them recently. They've always been nice to me
        and I'm happy that moises is always offering me a ride back home or to VT 
        <br>
        <br>     
        I've also had a good time whenever I'm with you and your sisters. I don't have any siblings but whether we're
        watching Avatar with Alexa and your dad or playing Overcooked with your little sisters, to me, it's like
        I'm apart of your family. Maybe it's just me but it's an experience I've never really had
        <br>

        Finally, I was going to add the picture of us sleeping in my bed with mono but I knew you'd shoot me. I'm bringing
        this up because I know that in 10-15 years I'll be taking the same picture except with our little falcon mono
        between us instead

    <p  id="fam_msg_2"  class="family_message">
        this is gonna be our little monos in the future (yes, we're having AT LEAST four 😛)
